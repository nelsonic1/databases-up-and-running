# Databases - Up and Running

The purpose of this repository is to enable you to explore different database technologies by giving step by step instructions to launch the database tech of your choice in Docker (where possible), load some data and write some queries in an afternoon.

An overview of each technology will be provided in each subsection. 

Pre-requisites:
* A working of installation of Docker (expertise not necessary*)

While Docker expertise is not necessary, a healthy understanding of what Docker is and why it may be useful will help you along.
